    "text": "Key Concepts\n\nData Collection\nThe first step in any data analysis project is collecting your data. This can come from various sources:\n\nPublic datasets: Government databases, research repositories, or open data platforms\nSurveys: Direct data collection through questionnaires\nAPIs: Programmatic access to data services\nWeb scraping: Extracting data from websites (with proper permissions)\n\n\n\nData Cleaning\nBefore you can analyze your data, you need to ensure it’s clean and ready for analysis:\n\nRemove duplicates: Eliminate redundant entries\nHandle missing values: Decide on appropriate strategies (imputation, removal, etc.)\nStandardize formats: Ensure consistent data types and formats\nValidate data: Check for outliers and inconsistencies\n\n\n\nExploratory Data Analysis\nOnce your data is clean, exploratory data analysis (EDA) helps you understand the patterns and relationships in your data:\nimport pandas as pd\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Load your data\ndf = pd.read_csv('data.csv')\n\n# Basic statistics\nprint(df.describe())\n\n# Visualize distributions\ndf.hist(figsize=(10, 6))\nplt.show()"
